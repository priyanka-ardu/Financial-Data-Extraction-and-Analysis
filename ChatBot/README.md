Step 1: Preparation
Review the analyzed data:
We previously analyzed the financial data, including Total Revenue, Net Income, Total Assets, Total Liabilities, and Cash Flow from Operating Activities. These figures will serve as the foundation for the predefined responses in the chatbot.

Set up the environment:
Ensure Python and the necessary libraries are installed. For this project, we need:

Python
pandas (for data handling)
Flask (for creating a simple web-based application, optional)
To install necessary libraries, use the following commands in the terminal:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas flask
Step 2: Chatbot Design and Data Preparation
Define predefined queries:
We will select 3 to 5 common financial queries related to the data:

"What is the total revenue?"
"How has net income changed over the last year?"
"What is the total net income?"
"What are the total assets?"
"What is the cash flow from operating activities?"
Prepare responses:
Based on the analyzed data (which we assume you already have for each company), here are the responses:

Total Revenue: The total revenue from the analysis.
Net Income Change: The year-over-year change in net income, based on your data analysis.
Net Income: The most recent year's net income.
Total Assets: The most recent year's total assets.
Cash Flow from Operating Activities: The most recent year's cash flow from operating activities.
Step 3: Basic Chatbot Development
Now, let's create a simple Python script that uses if-else statements to match user input to predefined queries.

Explanation of the Code:
Financial Data Dictionary:
The financial_data dictionary contains the financial metrics for Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple. The key-value pairs hold the financial data for each company.

simple_chatbot Function:
The function takes user input (user_query) and matches it against predefined queries using if-else statements. The function returns the corresponding data for the requested financial query.

User Interaction:
A simple input() function allows the user to ask a query. The chatbot will then respond based on the predefined conditions.

Step 4: Demonstration and Documentation
Test the chatbot:

Run the script.
Test by entering queries like "What is the total revenue?", "What is the total net income?", etc.
Documentation:

Functionality:
The chatbot is designed to respond to a limited set of predefined financial queries. It is based on simple if-else statements that map queries to responses containing financial data.

Predefined Queries:

"What is the total revenue?"
"How has net income changed over the last year?"
"What is the total net income?"
"What are the total assets?"
"What is the cash flow from operating activities?"
Limitations:

The chatbot can only respond to predefined queries; it cannot handle complex or unrecognized queries.
The financial data is hardcoded for the companies listed (Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple). It doesnâ€™t fetch real-time data or handle dynamic inputs about the company name.
