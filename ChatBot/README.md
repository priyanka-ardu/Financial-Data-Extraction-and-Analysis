# AI Chatbot Development for Financial Insights

## Step 1: Preparation

### Review the Analyzed Data:
We previously analyzed the financial data, including **Total Revenue**, **Net Income**, **Total Assets**, **Total Liabilities**, and **Cash Flow from Operating Activities**. These figures will serve as the foundation for the predefined responses in the chatbot.

### Set Up the Environment:
Ensure Python and the necessary libraries are installed. For this project, we need:

- **Python**
- **pandas** (for data handling)
- **Flask** (for creating a simple web-based application, optional)

To install necessary libraries, use the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
pip install pandas flask
```

## Step 2: Chatbot Design and Data Preparation

### Define Predefined Queries:
We will select 3 to 5 common financial queries related to the data:

- "What is the total revenue?"
- "How has net income changed over the last year?"
- "What is the total net income?"
- "What are the total assets?"
- "What is the cash flow from operating activities?"

### Prepare Responses:
Based on the analyzed data (which we assume you already have for each company), here are the responses:

- **Total Revenue**: The total revenue from the analysis.
- **Net Income Change**: The year-over-year change in net income, based on your data analysis.
- **Net Income**: The most recent year's net income.
- **Total Assets**: The most recent year's total assets.
- **Cash Flow from Operating Activities**: The most recent year's cash flow from operating activities.

## Step 3: Basic Chatbot Development

Now, let's create a simple Python script that uses if-else statements to match user input to predefined queries.

### Explanation of the Code:

#### Financial Data Dictionary:
The `financial_data` dictionary contains the financial metrics for Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple. The key-value pairs hold the financial data for each company.

#### `simple_chatbot` Function:
The function takes user input (`user_query`) and matches it against predefined queries using if-else statements. The function returns the corresponding data for the requested financial query.

#### User Interaction:
A simple `input()` function allows the user to ask a query. The chatbot will then respond based on the predefined conditions.

```python
def simple_chatbot(user_query):
    if user_query == "What is the total revenue?":
        return "The total revenue is [amount]."
    elif user_query == "How has net income changed over the last year?":
        return "The net income has [increased/decreased] by [amount] over the last year."
    elif user_query == "What is the total net income?":
        return "The total net income is [amount]."
    elif user_query == "What are the total assets?":
        return "The total assets are [amount]."
    elif user_query == "What is the cash flow from operating activities?":
        return "The cash flow from operating activities is [amount]."
    else:
        return "Sorry, I can only provide information on predefined queries."
```

## Step 4: Demonstration and Documentation

### Test the Chatbot:
- Run the script.
- Test by entering queries like "What is the total revenue?", "What is the total net income?", etc.

### Documentation:

#### Functionality:
The chatbot is designed to respond to a limited set of predefined financial queries. It is based on simple if-else statements that map queries to responses containing financial data.

#### Predefined Queries:

- "What is the total revenue?"
- "How has net income changed over the last year?"
- "What is the total net income?"
- "What are the total assets?"
- "What is the cash flow from operating activities?"

#### Limitations:

- The chatbot can only respond to predefined queries; it cannot handle complex or unrecognized queries.
- The financial data is hardcoded for the companies listed (Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple). It doesnâ€™t fetch real-time data or handle dynamic inputs about the company name.
